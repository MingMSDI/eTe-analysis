             /analysis/3 - analysis code by MH
             /analysis/4 - analysis code by IFS
             /analysis/5 - analysis code by PYK
			 /analysis/common_lib - store common libraries such as data reader class
			 /analysis/sample - store standardized code templates for syntax and format
             
             
 # Data Sources
 The raw datasets are about Mental Health and Suicide Rates.
 
 * source 1 : https://www.kaggle.com/twinkle0705/mental-health-and-suicide-rates?select=Human+Resources.csv 
	 - age_standardized_suicide_rates.csv : Age standardized suicide rates for different years
	 - crude_suicide_rates.csv : Suicide rates(year 2016) per 100000 population in different age range
	 - facilities.csv : Facilities available of different countries in 2016
	 - human_resources.csv : Human resources available of different countries in 2016

* source 2 : https://data.worldbank.org/indicator
	 - socioeconomic_indicator.csv: the latest poverty rate and GINI coefficient (income inequality) per country

 
 # How to start with the repository
 - Fork this repository to your personal remote repository(account)
 
     This will be your own remote repo to which you push your locally committed changes and 
     from which (browser interface) you will make your pull request.
 
 - In your local machine, create local repository, 
    in your preferred workspace,
    
      git init
      
 - Connect to your personal remote repo from your local repo
 
      git remote add origin master https://github.com/xxxxxx/eTe-analysis.git
 
 - Clone your remote repo into your local machine
 
      git pull origin master ("clone" also works)
      
  Then every thing is ready. So there are altogether three stages of repository.
  
  local repo --> personal remote repo --> team's master remote repo
  
  # Commit the local changes to local and (personal) remote repo
  
  - Secure the local changes 

      git add your_file_name.ext

      git commit -m "your change message"
      
  - Push to remote repo 

      git push
 
 
 # General Rule of Thumb in Creating Tasks, Assigining Tasks and Making Pull Requests
 
- Use "Issues" tab to register the tasks to which member(s) are assigned or your favourite tasks assigned to yourself
- State Issue Id  "#xx" in the pull request name / title/ message to allow the teams knows that what your Pull request is about and to which task(issue) it is for

# Important!!!! Keep your local repository updated everyday.

- Make sure you commit your local changes first
- Always make git pull before starting your work of the day in your local directory/repo

    git pull https://github.com/mdsi-dsp-at2/eTe-analysis
    
 - Strongly encourage to do this even before the PUSH and making new Pull Request.
 - This practice will help to avoid unnecessary code conflicts.
    
# How to view your commit history in local

 - View the history in list style

    git log --oneline --decorate 
    
 - View the history in graph style 

    git log --graph --oneline --decorate
